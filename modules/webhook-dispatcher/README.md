# Webhook Dispatcher

**Category:** `infra` · **Status:** stable

Fan-out webhook dispatcher for multiple integrations with configurable timeout and error handling. Posts events to active endpoints, logs responses for audit, and handles failures gracefully.

## Use it

The implementation is a single self-contained file: [`src/index.ts`]("src/index.ts").
Copy it into your project, import the exported members, and call them as shown in the source.
It has one responsibility and no dependency on the rest of this library.

## Why this exists

Extracted as an atomic, single-purpose unit from a real, running production system — so you
can lift exactly this one capability into a completely different project without dragging a
framework along.
